## (CURRENT) IDONTHAVEANAME : C:> namegen
IDONTHAVEANAME is annoying to type, so I'll refer to it as IDHAN.
IDHAN is a x86_64-based operating system with interrupt handling, 8259 PIC support, ACPI support, and much more down the road.
IDHAN's "name" is a joke based on a DOS command "namegen" suggesting the name "IDONTHAVEANAME"

Currently IDHAN is going smoothly, just treading the typical x86_64 boilerplate like normal.

*i'm also adding a UEFI bootloader to it as we speak

I plan on adding things such as a printf implementation, APIC support, scheduling,
and (MAYBE) higher-level language support.
IDHAN's "name" 100% is subject to change. 

## (HALTED) quik :  Quik is a x86_64-based operating-system
with multiple-terminal support, interrupt handling and... uh-oh, my list stopped!
Took a break sometime early 2022, not sure when I'm coming back.
RIP(?)

## (QUIT) Cherri : Cherri is a x86_64-based operating-system
Very poor into development and quit sometime in 2021.
RIP.
